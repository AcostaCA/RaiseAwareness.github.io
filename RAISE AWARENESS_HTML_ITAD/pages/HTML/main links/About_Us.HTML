	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website aims to <b>Raise Awareness</b> to those who are being abused, discriminated and hatred.
	Some of the issues mention on our website is already known and being tackled by the society nowadays. We
	hope to open other people eyes in order to be able to spread news and love, instead of spreading hate towards
	one another.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness-raising is a process that seeks to inform and educate people about a topic or issue with 
	the intention of influencing their attitudes, behaviours and beliefs towards the achievement of a defined purpose or goal.
	It can mobilize the power of public opinion in support of an issue and thereby influence the political will of decision 
	makers. There are multiple awareness-raising strategies, methods and tools that can be used to convey and spread messages,
	and to gather the support necessary to influence public opinion.</p>
	
	<p>Depending on the topic, awareness-raising efforts may include the following activities: 
	issuing press releases, briefings and commentaries; disseminating reports, studies and publications; making 
	written or oral submissions to parliamentary committees and inquiries; 
	working with the media; holding public meetings and events; convening conferences and workshops; and creating and 
	contributing to educational materials. Information may be disseminated through a range of different means or tools 
	such as radio, television, video, film, the internet, social media, mobile phones, newspapers, newsletters, leaflets, 
	poster campaigns and the arts. A variety of visual tools such as stickers, logos, t-shirts, armbands, bracelets 
	and banners also may be used.</p>
