	<h3>Sexism</h3>
	<video width="500px" height="400px" controls><source src="../../../media/videos/Sexism.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
	<p>Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on one's sex or gender. 
	Sexism can affect anyone, but it primarily affects women and girls. 
	It has been linked to stereotypes and gender roles,
	and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another.
	Extreme sexism may foster sexual harassment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence.
	Gender discrimination may encompass sexism, and is discrimination toward people based on their gender identity
	or their gender or sex differences. Gender discrimination is especially defined in terms of workplace inequality.
	It may arise from social or cultural customs and norms.</p>

	<h4>Elements of Sexism</h4>
	<img style="width:600px; height:auto; " src="../../../media/images/elements/sexism1.jpg" >
	<p>Sexism includes attitudes or ideology, including beliefs, theories, 
	and ideas that hold one group (usually male) as deservedly superior to 
	the other (usually female), and that justify oppressing members of the 
	other group on the basis of their sex or gender.</p>
	
	<p>Sexism involves practices and institutions and the ways in which 
	oppression is carried out. These need not be done with a conscious 
	sexist attitude but may be unconscious cooperation in a system that 
	has been in place already in which one sex (usually female) has less 
	power and fewer goods in the society.</p>

	<h4>Occupational sexism</h4>
	<img style="width:600px; height:auto; " src="../../../media/images/elements/sexism2.jpg" >
	<p>Occupational sexism refers to discriminatory practices, statements or actions,
	based on a person's sex, occurring in the workplace. One form of occupational
	sexism is wage discrimination. In 2008, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
	and Development (OECD) found that while female employment rates have expanded and 
	gender employment and wage gaps have narrowed nearly everywhere, on average women 
	still have 20% less chance to have a job and are paid 17% less than men.</p>
