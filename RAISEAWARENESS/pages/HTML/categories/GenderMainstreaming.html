	<h4>Gender Mainstreaming</h4>
	<img style="width:600px; height:auto; " src="../../../media/images/elements/genmain1.png" >
	<p>Gender mainstreaming has been embraced internationally as a 
	strategy towards realizing gender equality. It involves the integration
	of a gender perspective into the preparation, design, implementation, 
	monitoring and evaluation of policies, regulatory measures and spending 
	programs, with a view to promoting equality between women and men, and 
	combating discrimination.</p>

<div class="text" id="importance">
	<h4>Importance</h4>
	
	<p>Gender mainstreaming ensures that policy-making and legislative work is of higher quality and has a greater relevance for society, because it makes policies respond more effectively to the needs of all citizens – women and men, girls and boys. Gender mainstreaming makes public interventions more effective and ensures that inequalities are not perpetuated.</p>
	
	<p>Gender mainstreaming does not only aim to avoid the creation or reinforcement of inequalities, which can have adverse effects on both women and men. It also implies analyzing the existing situation, with the purpose of identifying inequalities, and developing policies which aim to redress these inequalities and undo the mechanisms that caused them.</p>

<div class="text" id="hiw">
	<h4>How it Works</h4>
	<img style="width:600px; height:auto; " src="../../../media/images/elements/genmain2.jpg" >
	<p>A political commitment for gender equality and a compatible legal framework are the basic conditions for the development of a successful gender mainstreaming strategy. In addition to concrete objectives and targets in the strategy, gender mainstreaming requires a clear action plan. Such plan should take into account the context, satisfy the necessary conditions, cover all the relevant dimensions, foresee the use of concrete methods and tools, set out the responsibilities and make sure that the necessary competences exist to achieve the anticipated results within a planned time frame.</p>
</div>


<div class="text" id="dimensions">
	<h4>Dimensions</h4>
	<p>Gender mainstreaming requires both integrating a gender perspective to the content of the different policies, and addressing the issue of representation of women and men in the given policy area. Both dimensions – gender representation and gender responsive content - need to be taken into consideration in all phases of the policy-making process.
