	<h4>Dog Fighting</h4>
	<img style="width:600px; height:auto; " src="../../../media/images/elements/dog2.jpg" >
	<p>Dog fighting is one of the most heinous forms of animal cruelty. Dogs used for fighting are typically raised in isolation, so they spend most of their lives on short, heavy chains. They are regularly conditioned for fighting through the use of drugs, including anabolic steroids to enhance muscle mass and encourage aggressiveness. Dog fighting victims may have their ears cropped and tails docked close to their bodies to minimize the animal’s normal body language cues and to limit areas that another dog can grab during a fight. Fighters usually perform this cropping/docking themselves using crude and inhumane techniques.</p>
	
	<p>Although dog fighting is a felony in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, it continues to occur in every part of the country and in every type of community. In the past decade, the ASPCA has assisted with approximately 200 dog fighting cases in at least 24 states, and has impacted through rescue, consultations and investigations nearly 5,000 victims of dog fighting.</p>

	<img style="width:600px; height:auto; " src="../../../media/images/elements/dog1.jpg" >
	<p>It is important to be able to recognize the signs identified with dogfighting so that you can report any suspected dog fighting activity to your local authorities.</p>
	
	<p>If you witness the following signs in your community and suspect dogfighting activity, you should consider contacting your local authorities immediately:</p>
	<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left:70px;">
<li>Dogs with multiple scars, possibly with lips or ears ripped off</li>
<li>Pit bull-mix-type dogs weighing approximately 40-50 pounds</li>
<li>Dogs on heavy chains, tethered to a tire axle or dog house/barrel</li>
<li>Dirt ring around the dog</li>
<li>Dogs chained inches apart from one another</li>
<li>Dogs chained or penned in a secluded area intentionally kept out of the public’s view</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that in urban communities like New York City, dogs used for fighting are often found living in secluded, indoor areas such as basements, where they are hidden from public view. Their ears may also be cropped.</p>
