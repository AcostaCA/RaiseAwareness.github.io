<h2 align="center">What Is Cultural Appropriation?</h2>
	<img src="../../../media/images/elements/culturalappropriation.jpg" alt="cultural" align="left" width="400px" hspace="20"/>	
	<p align="left">Cultural appropriation refers to the use of objects or elements of a non-dominant 
	culture in a way that doesn't respect their original meaning, give credit to their source, or reinforces 
	stereotypes or contributes to oppression.<br><br>In this way, cultural appropriation is a layered and nuanced phenomenon 
	that many people may have trouble understandingâ€”or may not realize when they are doing it themselves.<br><br>It may be 
	natural to merge and blend cultures as people from different backgrounds come together and interact. In fact, 
	many wonderful inventions and creations have been born from the merging of such cultures, such as country music. 
	However, the line is drawn when a dominant cultural group makes use of elements of a non-dominant group in a way 
	that the non-dominant group views as exploitative.<br><br>

	<blockquote><blockquote><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a step backward, how do we define cultural appropriation? Let's first consider what is meant by each of the terms in the 
	phrase as well as some related terms that are important to understand.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h3>Culture</h3>
<img src="../../../media/images/elements/culture.jpg" alt="Save Ralph Poster" align="right" width="300px" hspace="20"/>
	<blockquote><blockquote><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Culture refers to anything associated with a group of people based on their ethnicity, 
	religion, geography, or social environment. This might include beliefs, traditions, language, 
	objects, ideas, behaviors, customs, values, or institutions. Most often, culture is thought of 
	as belonging to particular ethnic groups.</p></blockquote></blockquote><br>

<h3>Appropriation</h3>
	<blockquote><blockquote><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriation refers to taking something that doesn't belong to 
	you and most often refers to an exchange that happens when a dominant group takes or borrows 
	something from a minority group that has historically been exploited or oppressed.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, 
	appropriation involves a lack of understanding of or appreciation for the historical context that influences the act 
	of what is being taken. For example, taking a sacred object from a culture and producing it as part of a Halloween
	costume.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<div id="respect" class="text">
<h3>Cultural Appreciation & Respect</h3>
	<blockquote><blockquote><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural appreciation is 
	the respectful borrowing of elements from another culture with an interest in sharing ideas and diversifying oneself.
	Examples would include learning martial arts from an instructor with an understanding of the practice from a cultural perspective or eating Indian food at an authentic Indian restaurant.
	When done correctly, cultural appreciation can result in creative hybrids that blend cultures together.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
