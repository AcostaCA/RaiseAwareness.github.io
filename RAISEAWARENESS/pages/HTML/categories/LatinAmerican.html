<h2>Latinos and discrimination</h2>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, four-in-ten 
Latinos say they have experienced discrimination in the past year, such as being criticized 
for speaking Spanish or being told to go back to their home country. These experiences are more 
likely among those who say others see them as Latino, black or another non-white group than among 
Latinos who say others see them as white. At the same time, just as many Latinos say someone 
in the past year had expressed support for them because they are Latino.</p><br>

	<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About two-thirds of U.S. Hispanics (68%) say that if people passed them on the street they would 
	describe them as Hispanic or Latino. Hispanics who are foreign born (79%) and second generation (68%) are more likely 
	than the third or higher generation (50%) to say this.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, about one-in-five Hispanics 
	(18%) say people passing them on the street would describe them as white. This share increases as immigrant 
	connections grow distant. About 10% of Hispanic immigrants say a person would describe them as white, while 16% 
	of the second generation and 33% of the third or higher generation say the same.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Hispanics with lower levels 
	of education also say those passing them on the street would see them as Hispanic or Latino. About 
	three-quarters of Hispanics with a high school diploma or less (77%) say this, compared with 56% of 
	those with some college education or higher. By contrast, about a quarter of Hispanics with some college 
	education or higher (27%) say people passing them on the street would describe them as white, compared with 
	12% of those with a high school education or less.</p>

	<blockquote><blockquote><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly four-in-10 Latinos 
	(37%) say that during the past 12 months, someone has expressed support for them because they are Hispanic or Latino. 
	Yet about the same share (38%) also say they have recently experienced one of four incidents – being called offensive 
	names, being told to go back to their home country, being criticized for speaking Spanish in public, or experiencing 
	discrimination or unfair treatment because they are Hispanic.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, about a 
	quarter of Latinos (24%) say someone has discriminated against them or treated them unfairly because of 
	their background, while 22% say someone has criticized them for speaking Spanish in public. About 20% say 
	they have been told to go back to their home country, and about 16% say they have been 
	called offensive names.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hispanic 
	immigrants and second-generation Hispanics (those born in the U.S. to at least one immigrant parent) 
	report more often than third or higher generation Hispanics being subjected to three of the four 
	incidents asked about in the survey – being criticized for speaking Spanish, being told to go back 
	to their home country and experiencing discrimination or unfair treatment.<br><br>The share of Latinos who say they have received an expression of support over 
	the past year is higher among Spanish-dominant (44%) and bilingual speakers 
	(39%) than among English-dominant speakers (27%). The bilingual and Spanish 
	dominant also reported more discrimination. About a quarter of Latinos who are bilingual 
	(28%) and Spanish dominant (25%) say they have experienced discrimination or been treated unfairly,
	compared with 19% of English-dominant Latinos. <br><br>For Hispanics, the way the world views their race or ethnicity 
	is linked to how often people express support for them and how often they experience discrimination.

	them on the street would see them as Hispanic or Latino or as black are more likely to say 
	someone expressed support for them in the past year because they are Latino. Those who say others see 
	them as white are less likely to say this has happened. A similar pattern is true when it comes to 
	experiencing discrimination: Those who say others see them as white are less likely than other groups of 
	Latinos to report experiencing one of the four incidents asked about in the survey.<br><br>Differences also exist by party affiliation among Hispanics – 
	more Democrats (43%) than Republicans (24%) say they have 
	experienced at least one of the four incidents.</p></blockquote></blockquote><br><br>
