	<p align="left">Bullying is not just a buzzword co-opted by the media to drive 
	ratings from frightened school children and their worried parents. Bullying is a 
	serious problem that has far-reaching implications for the person being bullied—and 
	for the bully as well. In this guide, readers will find information on what bullying 
	is, how it impacts people, and where victims can get help. In addition, there is information 
	on the mental health industry’s response to bullying and why psychologists are uniquely equipped 
	to handle this issue.</p>

				<td><ul>
					<li>Bullying in the workplace is usually about power and control.</li>
					<li>In over 70 percent of the cases, the bullying is boss to subordinate.</li>

					<li>Being targeted becomes all-consuming and it is usually impossible to think about anything else while it is going on.</li>
					<li>One of the most disturbing aspects is the inability for targets to find closure even after the bullying has stopped, because of the scars it leaves.</li>
				</ul></td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>Some emotions victims experience include depression, anxiety, loneliness and decreased self-esteem.</li>
					<li>Youth who bully are also at increased risk for depression and anxiety.</li>

				<td>Is there anything someone being bullied can do?</td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>Do not deal with it alone, go to someone you trust and strategize on how to confront it.</li>
					<li>Do not go to human resources unless you have total and absolute trust in their ability to remedy the situation, because in many cases, human resources offices are viewed as part of the problem versus part of the solution.</li>
				</ul></td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>Bystander intervention has been shown successful.</li>
					<li>Targets of bullying are encouraged to tell a trusted adult to obtain help, as adults have the authority and ability to address such behavior.</li>
					<li>Friendship has been shown to be a protective factor from the consequences of bullying, and resilience a product of positive, caring relationships with adults.</li>
					<li>Ignoring a problem does not make it go away.</li>
				</ul></td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>It is not the victim’s responsibility to protect themselves in school; it is the duty of the school to create a non-hostile atmosphere where students do not have to worry about hurt or humiliation and can concentrate on their learning.</li>		
				</ul></td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td>How can bullying be prevented?</td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>By creating psychologically healthy and safe work environments.</li>
					
				</ul></td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>Bullying is a problem that occurs well beyond the school years and prevention will take a comprehensive societal approach. There are evidenced-based bullying prevention programs and social-emotional learning programs for schools that have been shown to be effective in reducing bullying.</li>
				</ul></td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>We can’t prevent bullying any more than we can prevent interpersonal aggression, but we can reduce the incidence and the viciousness of bullying by moving our school communities away from retributive behavior.</li>		
					<li>“Restorative processes,” such as making affirmative statements, leading proactive circle conferences, using reintegrative shame management, and a restorative approach in family conferences can help build more civil school societies.</li>

	<h4>Physical Bullying/Violence</h4>
	<h6>What is physical bullying?</h6>

It can also occur where students gather together outside of school hours, such as at bus stops.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
	<h6>How can physical bullying be reported?</h6>
	<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Children should be encouraged to tell an adult when they have been physically bullied, or threatened with physical harm. They can go to their parents or their school to get help. If a physical assault has occurred, victims can also go to the police.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

	<h6>How can physical bullying be prevented?</h6>
	<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>School interventions can go a long way toward preventing bullying. School districts can educate parents, children, and teachers about bullying, and create anti-bullying policies to protect victims and stop bullies. In addition, administrators can study the bullying that goes on in their school to determine how much it is taking place and whether or not education efforts are working.

Parents can also contribute to bullying prevention by instilling certain values in their children, such as kindness and empathy. Creating the right mindset in children can help to prevent a child from becoming a bully.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
