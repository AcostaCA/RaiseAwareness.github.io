	<blockquote><p>The most common hazard in forests is forests fire. Forests fires are as old as the forests themselves. They pose a threat 
	not only to the forest wealth but also to the entire regime to fauna and flora seriously disturbing the bio-diversity and the ecology 
	and environment of a region. During summer, when there is no rain for months, the forests become littered with dry senescent leaves 
	and twinges, which could burst into flames ignited by the slightest spark.
	</p>
	<p>According to 2020 statistics, From January 1st to August 20th of 2020, Brazil has reported approximately 74.1 thousand wildfire outbreaks. 
	Argentina was the South American country with the second largest number of wildfires, at over 41.3 thousand. On the other hand, 18 wildfires 
	were detected in French Guiana in the given period, the lowest number among all the South American countries and territories</p>
	<p>In 2021, The 2021 California wildfire season is an ongoing series of wildfires that have burned across the state of California. 
	As of April 21, 2021, a total of 845 fires were recorded, including 297 that burned 1,171 acres (4.74 km2) on nonfederal land, 
	according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. As of May 3, only one fire exceeding 1,000 acres has occurred. 
	The season was predicted to be destructive due to the amount of fires burnt in January, including the Bonita Fire. Fires have been burning 
	in the same areas as previous fires like the CZU Lightning Complex. Numerous steps have been taken to reduce fire risks amid widespread 
	destruction of the 2020 California wildfire season</p>

	<h3>Causes of Forest fires</h3>
		<video width="500" height="350" controls="controls">

	</video>
	<ul>
		<li>Natural causes- Many forest fires start from natural causes such as lightning which set trees on fire. However, rain extinguishes such fires 
		without causing much damage. High atmospheric temperatures and dryness (low humidity) offer favorable circumstance for a fire to start.</li><br>
		<li>Man made causes- Fire is caused when a source of fire like naked flame, cigarette or bidi, electric spark or any source of ignition 
		comes into contact with inflammable material.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Environmental causes</strong> are largely related to climatic conditions such as temperature, wind speed and direction, level of moisture in soil and 
	atmosphere and duration of dry spells. Other natural causes are the friction of bamboos swaying due to high wind velocity and rolling stones that result in sparks setting off fires in highly inflammable leaf litter on the forest floor.
	<br><br><strong>Human related causes </strong> result from human activity as well as methods of forest management.</p>
	
	<h3>Effects of Forest fires</h3>
	<p>The consequences of forest fires are devastating with their increased frequency. When they rarely occur, the forest has its way to rebuild itself. 
	But when its natural cycle is disturbed due to the increased frequency of fires caused by people, the entire ecosystem is affected. Fires are a 
	major cause of forest degradation and have wide ranging adverse ecological, economic and social impacts, including:</p>
	<ul align="left">
		<li>loss of valuable timber resources</li>
		<li>degradation of catchment areas</li>
		<li>loss of biodiversity and extinction of plants and animals</li>
		<li>loss of wildlife habitat and depletion of wildlife</li>
		<li>loss of natural regeneration and reduction in forest cover</li>
		<li>global warming</li>
		<li>soil erosion affecting productivity of soils and production</li>
		<li>ozone layer depletion</li>
		<li>health problems leading to diseases</li>
		<li>change in the microclimate of the area with unhealthy living conditions</li>

	<h3>We Have to Protect Our Environment</h3>

	<p>When fires occur naturally, they are beneficial. It’s nature’s way of reinventing itself. Wood ash is a great fertilizer, which contains calcium, potassium, and magnesium. After a fire, the forest becomes more fertile. Due to the nutrients in ash, acidic soils are neutralized and may support the growth of new plants. However, the fact that human error is the cause of a great deal of forest fires is devastating. Wildfires are 
	becoming more common and harder to control. In our attempts to control them, we cause side 
	effects with the chemicals that we have to use.</p>
