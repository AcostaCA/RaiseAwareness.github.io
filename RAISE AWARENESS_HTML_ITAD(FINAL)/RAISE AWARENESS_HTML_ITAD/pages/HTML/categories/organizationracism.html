		Ensuring that no child appears in immigration court without high quality legal representation;
		Advancing laws, policies, and practices that ensure children’s protection and uphold their right to due process and fundamental fairness; and
		Promoting in countries of origin, transit, and destination durable solutions to child migration that are 
		grounded in the best interests of the child and ensure that no child is forced to involuntarily migrate.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p>
