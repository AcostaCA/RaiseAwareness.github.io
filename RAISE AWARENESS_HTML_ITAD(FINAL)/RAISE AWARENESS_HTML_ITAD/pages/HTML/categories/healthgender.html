	<p>Gender inequality damages the physical and mental health of millions of girls and women across the globe, and also of boys and men 
	despite the many tangible benefits it gives men through resources, power, authority and control. </p>
	<p>In addition to overall mortality and morbidity, certain health and wellbeing issues are more commonly associated with one gender. 
	For example, dementia, depression and arthritis are more common in women, while men are more prone to lung cancer, cardiovascular disease and suicide</p>

	<p>Gender stereotypes affect children's sense of self from a young age. It also affect behaviour, study choices, ambitions and attitudes about relationships.
	With the prevalence of gender discrimination, and social norms and practices, girls become exposed to the possibility of child marriage, 
	teenage pregnancy, child domestic work, poor education and health, sexual abuse, exploitation and violence. Many of these manifestations will not change unless girls are valued more.</p>
	<p>Gender discrimination and women's low status are at the root of women's limited autonomy and of the denial of their rights to health and bodily integrity: when women suffer poor 
	mental and physical health and limited decision-making power this, in turn, impacts negatively on their children's survival, healthy growth</p>

	<p>Violent behaviour is generally perceived to be an integral part of male behaviour and as a normal feature of being a man. Violence is, in fact, culturally ‘masculinised.’ Gender-based violence is related to systems and feelings of power – the oppression of women and certain groups of men. Gender inequality perpetuates a culture of violence. When women are viewed as something less, as persons subjected to male authority, 
	men feel less hesitation in using and degrading women for their own satisfaction as their satisfaction is deemed to be of greater importance.</p>
		
		<p>Gender inequality not only affects individual employees, it can also affect the overall economic performance of the organization. 
		Besides being illegal, discriminating on the basis of gender has far reaching implications for your female employees as well as for their male colleagues. 
		Here are just a few of the harmful effects of gender discrimination in the workplace:</p>
	<div align="left">
	<ul>
		<li>Mental Health</li>
		<p>Gender discrimination victims often experience harassment which can lead to increased depression and anxiety.</p>
		<li>Stress </li>
		<p> Unfair treatment increases stress levels which can lead to greater chances of physical illness. 
		This causes employees to become tardy or absent because of health problems.</p>
		<li>Decreased job satisfaction</li>
		<p>When there is gender inequality happening at the workplace, discriminated individuals never reach 
		the level needed for a high-status job and therefore do not have a high satisfaction with their job.</p>
		<li>Increased turnover </li>
		<p> Because there is a negative impact on one’s happiness and health, sexual harassment increases the chances of employee turnover. Women, more often than men, 
		leave high paying executive positions, citing lack of opportunities, inflexible work hours and a lack of female peers. </p>
		<li>Inequality contributes to harassment </li>
		<p>When gender inequality exists in a workplace, the company culture can be less attentive to sexual harassment issues. Victims of gender inequality are less likely to come forward with complaints in such culture than they would be in a workplace that embraces both genders. 
		This is because the victims believe that their complaints will not be taken seriously or will fall on deaf ears.</p>
		<li>Bad reputation</li>
		<p>The harmful effects of gender inequality do not stop at the company’s lobby doors. 
		Public allegations of gender discrimination can hurt the brand image of a company as well as its stock price. </p>
