	<h4>Gender Inequality</h4>
	<img style="width:600px; height:auto; " src="../../../media/images/elements/genine2.jpg" >
	<p>Gender inequality is the social process by which men and women are
	not treated as equals. The treatment may arise from distinctions regarding
	biology, psychology, or cultural norms. Some of these distinctions are
	empirically-grounded while others appear to be socially constructed. Gender 
	inequality also affects non-binary people. Studies show the different 
	lived experiences of genders across many domains including education, 
	life expectancy, personality, interests, family life, careers, 
	and political affiliations. Gender inequality is experienced differently 
	across different cultures</p>

	<h4>Causes of Gender Inequality</h4>
	<img style="width:600px; height:auto; " src="../../../media/images/elements/genine1.jpg" >
	<h5>Uneven access to education</h5>
		<p>Around the world, women still have less access to education than 
		men. ¼ of young women between 15-24 will not finish primary school. 
		That group makes up 58% of the people not completing that basic 
		education. Of all the illiterate people in the world, ⅔ are women. 
		When girls are not educated on the same level as boys, it has a huge 
		effect on their future and the kinds of opportunities they’ll get.</p>
		
		<h5>Job segregation</h5>
		<p>One of the causes for gender inequality within employment 
		is the division of jobs. In most societies, there’s an inherent 
		belief that men are simply better equipped to handle certain jobs. 
		Most of the time, those are the jobs that pay the best. This discrimination 
		results in lower income for women. Women also take on the primary 
		responsibility for unpaid labor, so even as they participate in the 
		paid workforce, they have extra work that never gets recognized financially.</p>
		
		<h5>Lack of legal protections</h5>
		<p>According to research from the World Bank, over one billion women don’t 
		have legal protection against domestic sexual violence or domestic economic
		violence. Both have a significant impact on women’s ability to thrive and
		live in freedom. In many countries, there’s also a lack of legal protections
		against harassment in the workplace, at school, and in public. These places 
		become unsafe and without protection, women frequently have to make decisions
		that compromise and limit their goals.</p>
		
		<h5>Poor medical care</h5>
		<p>In addition to limited access to contraception, women overall receive 
		lower-quality medical care than men. This is linked to other gender inequality 
		reasons such as a lack of education and job opportunities, which results 
		in more women being in poverty. They are less likely to be able to afford 
		good healthcare. There’s also been less research into diseases that affect 
		women more than men, such as autoimmune disorders and chronic pain conditions. 
		Many women also experience discrimination and dismissal from their doctors, broadening 
		the gender gap in healthcare quality.</p>
		
		<h5>Lack of religious freedom</h5>
		<p>When religious freedom is attacked, women suffer the most. 
		According to the World Economic Forum, when extremist ideologies 
		(such as ISIS) come into a community and restrict religious freedom, 
		gender inequality gets worse. In a study performed by Georgetown 
		University and Brigham Young University, researchers were also able 
		to connect religious intolerance with women’s ability to participate 
		in the economy. When there’s more religious freedom, an economy becomes 
		more stable thanks to women’s participation.</p>
		
		<h5>Lack of political representation</h5>
		<p>Of all national parliaments at the beginning of 2019, only 24.3% of seats 
		were filled by women. As of June of 2019, 11 Heads of State were women. Despite 
		progress in this area over the years, women are still grossly underrepresented 
		in government and the political process. This means that certain issues that 
		female politicians tend to bring up – such as parental leave and childcare, 
		pensions, gender equality laws and gender-based violence – are often neglected.</p>
