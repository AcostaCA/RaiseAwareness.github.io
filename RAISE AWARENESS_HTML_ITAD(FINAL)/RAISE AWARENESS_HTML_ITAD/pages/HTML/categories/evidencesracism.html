	<h2><li>Ethnic Korean teen assaulted in Netherlands in racist attack</li></h2>
	<p>A 16-year-old boy (of Korean descent) was kicked in his face this weekend at Jagersplas, The Netherlands, which all started with a racist comment. The mother of the victim has shared this video in order to raise awareness to the case, find the perpetrators and to get justice.
	The mother explained the situation as follows: Yesterday her son encountered a group of 5 people who told him: “What are you looking at, cancer Chinese with your Corona. ”After this, they came back with a big group of 20 people, in which one of the perpetrators took her son’s phone. 
	In response to this the son took the phone back in which the perpetrators said he had to apologise for taking the phone back. The son apologised in order to not get in further trouble with the big group. 
	Following to this, you see that he smiled a bit because he did not know how to respond to the whole situation, in which the perpetrator got angry and kicked him in the face. Shortly after, the group left and threatened the son that they would go after him if he would go to the police.

	<p>Police brutality is the excessive and unwarranted use of force by law enforcement. It is an extreme form of police misconduct or violence 
	and is a civil rights violation. It also refers to a situation where officers exercise undue or excessive force against a person. Police 
	violence includes but is not limited to physical or verbal harassment, physical or mental injury, property damage, inaction of police officers, and in some cases, death.[1] In the United States, qualified immunity is a legal doctrine used to protect officers from litigation after incidents of police violence. This law issued by the Supreme Court in 1982 is often used to undermine the civil rights act of 1871, otherwise known as 42 USC 1983.
