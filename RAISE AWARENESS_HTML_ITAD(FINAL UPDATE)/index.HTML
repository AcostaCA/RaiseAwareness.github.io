	<p>Racism is ugly. It divides people into “us” and “them”,
	based on where we come from or the colour of our
	skin. And it happens when people feel that it’s okay to
	treat others badly as they go about their daily lives.</p>
	<p>Racism is the belief that there are human groups with particular 
	(usually physical) characteristics that make them superior or inferior to 
	others. Racist behaviour can be not just overt, such as treating some people 
	according to their race or colour, but also covert, when society systematically 
	treats groups according to some form of discriminating judgement.</p>

	<p>Discrimination is the unfair or prejudicial treatment of 
	people and groups based on characteristics such as race, gender, 
	age or sexual orientation. That’s the simple answer. But explaining why it 
	happens is more complicated. The human brain naturally puts things in categories 
	to make sense of the world. Very young children quickly learn the difference between 
	boys and girls, for instance. But the values we place on different categories are 
	learned – from our parents, our peers and the observations we make about how the world 
	works. Often, discrimination stems from fear and misunderstanding.</p><br>

	<ul>Cruelty and neglect cross all social and economic boundaries and media reports suggest that 
	animal abuse is common in both rural and urban areas.
	  <li>Intentional cruelty to animals is 
		strongly correlated with other crimes, including violence against people</li>
	  <li>Hoarding behavior often victimizes animals. Sufferers of a hoarding disorder 
		may impose severe neglect on animals by housing far more than they are able to adequately 
		take care of. Serious animal neglect (such as hoarding) is often an indicator of people in need of social 
		or mental health services.</li>

	<p>Gender equality is when people of all genders have equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities. 
	Everyone is affected by gender inequality - women, men, transgendered and gender diverse people, children 
	and families. It impacts people of all ages and backgrounds. We need gender equality urgently. Gender 
	equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that 
	value women and men as equal are safer and healthier.<br><br></p>
