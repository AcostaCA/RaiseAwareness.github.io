<h2 align="center">Circus Animals</h2>
	<blockquote><p>The truth about animals in circuses is that they are abused and endure lives of complete misery, while some are even poached from the wild, purely for entertainment.
	Circuses around the world continue to use animals in their shows and very few countries have banned the practice.</p>

	<p>In Vietnam, we’ve seen species which are protected by national and international law performing in circuses. This includes elephants and moon bears. 
	Laws state that these species cannot be poached from the wild or sold for commercial purposes. We also know that no bear bile farmers in Vietnam were able to successfully breed captive bears – so where are the circus animals coming from?
	The truth is some are highly likely to have been illegally poached from the wild and sold into the entertainment industry.</p>
	<p>In circuses, animals are made to perform unnatural tricks which no individual would willingly carry out.
	Elephants are made to stand on one leg and spin in circles – often while standing on top of small stools. These are actions elephants have never been observed carrying out in the wild precisely because they cause long-term damage to the animals’ physiology.
	It is well documented that elephants are forced to perform these actions by being beaten with bullhooks, while young elephants are savagely constrained and beaten in a process known as “the crush”, which breaks their spirit and forces them to comply.

	<img src="../../../media/images/elements/circus2.jpg" alt="whaling" align="left" width="500px" height="400px" hspace="20">
	<ol>
		<li>Tigers naturally fear fire, but they are still forced to jump through fire hoops in some circuses and have been burned while doing so.</li><br>
		<li>Circus animals have the right to be protected and treated humanely under the Animal Welfare Act</li><br>
		<li>Circuses are repeatedly cited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the Animal Welfare Act for trailers that have splintering wood and sharp, protruding metal pieces near animals' cages.</li><br>
		<li>Trainers use whips, tight collars, muzzles, electric prods, bullhooks and other painful tools of the trade to force animals to perform.</li><br>
		<li>In more than 35 dangerous incidents since 2000, elephants have bolted from circuses, run amok through streets, crashed into buildings, attacked members of the public, and killed and injured handlers.</li><br>
		<li>Every major circus that uses animals has been cited for violating the minimal standards of care set by the United States Animal Welfare (AWA).</li><br>
		<li>11 months a year they travel over long distances in box cars with no climate control; sleeping, eating, and defecating in the same cage.</li><br>

		<li>During the off-season, animals used in circuses may be housed in small traveling crates. Such confinement has harmful psychological effects on them. These effects are often indicated by unnatural behavior such as repeated swaying, and pacing.</li><br>
		<li>Lack of exercise and long hours standing on hard surfaces are major contributors to foot infections and arthritis, the leading causes of death among captive elephants.</li><br>

	<ul>
		<li>When the circus comes to town, hold a demonstration to inform the public that demeaning stunts performed by animals in the ring are the result of behind-the-scenes abuse. Let your local news outlet know about the suffering that animals used in circuses endure.</li><br>

		<li>Circuses are repeatedly cited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the Animal Welfare Act for trailers that have splintering wood and sharp, protruding metal pieces near animals' cages.</li><br>
		<li>Avoid all circuses that use animals. Talk to friends and family members, particularly those with young children who might be especially inclined to go.</li><br>
